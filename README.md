This repository contains the 113270 folder, which contains the replication package from the paper “Consumption Inequality and Partial Insurance” by Richard Blundell, Luigi Pistaferri, and Ian Preston (2008). It also contains our implementation and approach to using gradient boosting machines (GBMs) to predict nondurable consumption from CEX data as detailed in our paper, along with the files we used to create the graphs, plots, and charts in our paper. See README.pdf for a more thorough overview.
